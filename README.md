# Promo Impact Dashboard: Measuring Promotion Effectiveness

## Table of content

## Project Overview

This project presents an end-to-end marketing analytics solution designed to measure the effectiveness of promotional campaigns across various product categories, customer segments, and regions. It uses a comprehensive, business-like dataset (10,000+ rows) to simulate real-world promotional activities over a 12-month period and analyzes the return on investment (ROI), sales lift, discount impact, and customer behavior.The final dashboard was built in Google Looker Studio and integrates insights from Excel-based data modeling   

## The Business Problem

Our marketing team regularly runs promotions ‚Äî from discounts to flash sales ‚Äî but there's been no structured way to measure which campaigns actually drive results. We needed a clear answer: "Which promos worked best, and were they worth the cost, which country should we increase promotional investment and what month of the year is best for promotion?"

## Project Objectives

- Track and compare ROI of different promotions types
- Identify which product categories and promo types perform best
- Measure sales lift before, during, and after promotions
- Visualize performance across regions, sales channels, and customer types
- Present clear insights and business recommendations

## Tools used and their purpose

- Excel Data preparation, cleaning, and metric creation
- Google Sheets Hosting dataset for Looker Studio integration
- Looker Studio Visualization, dashboard, filtering, insights

## Dataset Description
- Total rows: 10,000+
- Duration: 12 months
- Simulated promotional data, including:
- Product Name, Category, Price
- Promo Type (e.g., 10% OFF, Flash Sale, BOGO)

## Metrics calculated in Excel and their formula
- Revenue = Unit Price √ó Units sold
- Discount % = discount/100
- Discounted Revenue = Revenue √ó (1 - discount %)
- Promo cost = Unit Price √ó Units sold √ó discount %


## Metrics calculated in looker Studio

- ROI = (Discounted Revenue - Promo Cost) / Promo Cost
- Sales Lift = Units During - Units Before
- Net Revenue = Discounted Revenue - Promo Cost

Hair Care & Fragrance categories performed best under promotions

Certain regions had high ROI but low volume ‚Äî opportunity for scaling

üïµÔ∏è‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è Insights & Recommendations

üîπ 1. Invest More in High-ROI Countries

Countries such as [insert top country from your dashboard] delivered strong ROI despite lower volume. These regions are ideal for increased promotional budget allocation to test for higher market response.

üîπ 2. Rethink Low-Volume High-ROI Strategies

10% OFF promotions yielded excellent ROI but reached fewer customers. These promos are cost-efficient but may need stronger marketing or bundling to scale.

üîπ 3. Maximize the ‚ÄúAfter‚Äù Phase Effect

Significant revenue was recorded in the post-promo period, suggesting that customers often buy after the official promo ends. This supports running post-promo reminders or limited-time extensions.

üîπ 4. Double Down on Top Product Categories

Categories like Hair Care responded especially well to promos. Focusing campaigns on these categories can drive higher ROI with less experimentation.

üîπ 5. Flash Sale = Best of Both Worlds

Flash Sale promos showed strong ROI and moderate volume. This balance makes them ideal for wide campaigns where both profit and engagement matter.

üîπ 6. Use Data to Refine Strategy

Rather than applying a uniform promo strategy, results show the need to tailor promos by region, customer segment, and product type.

## Business Impact
This dashboard empowers the team to allocate budgets better, prioritize high-performing promotions, and target the right products and segments. It turns raw data into actionable marketing decisions.

## Conclusion

This project showcases both technical skill and business thinking ‚Äî from preparing data in Excel, to modeling ROI and sales lift, to building a clean dashboard in Looker Studio, and finally to communicating results through meaningful insights.
Perfect for marketers, analysts, and decision-makers who want to measure the real impact of their campaigns.
